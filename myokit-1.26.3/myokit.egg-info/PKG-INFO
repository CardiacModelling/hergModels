Description: Myokit
        ======
        
        Myokit is a free piece of software that facilitates modeling and simulation in
        cardiac cellular electrophysiology.
        
        For details and downloads, see http://myokit.org
        
        For the latests documentation, see http://docs.myokit.org
        
        Quick-start guide
        -----------------
        
        To quickly test if myokit is running, open a terminal or command window,
        navigate to the myokit directory and type
        
            python myo run example
            
        To open an IDE window, type
        
            python myo
            
        To see what else the "myo" script can do, type
        
            python myo -h
        
        Adding icons etc.
        -----------------
        If you're a Gnome or KDE user, you may wish to install a Myokit icon to your
        menu, add the mime-type information for myokit mmt files or add syntax
        highlighting for gtksourceview (gedit). Scripts to do this are located in
            
            ./install/gnome-kde
        
        Windows users can install icons using the Myokit installer, available on
         http://myokit.org
