# hERG model selection 
A significant source of uncertainty is the lack of precise knowledge about the underlying mechanisms leading to structural uncertainty in cardiac models. This is a collection of tools for :
1) Fitting hERG ion-channel models to IKr current data.
2) Bayesian model ranking is used to address the said uncertainties in the hERG ion-channel models.
